eefcflash is a flash programming utility for Atmel's SAM family of
EEFC flash-based ARM microcontrollers. The motivation behind eefcflash is to
create a simple, easy-to-use, open source utility to replace Atmel's
SAM-BA software; also because it is easier to write new code from
scratch than to debug other people's C++ code.

Note: this should work on all of the atmel sam cortex M3, M4, and M7
devices. but not the M0 devices.
